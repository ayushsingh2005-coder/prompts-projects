**Solution:**  
We developed a **Flask-based Attendance Management System** that allows teachers/admins to:  
- Mark attendance for students daily  
- Store records in a database (SQLite)  
- View attendance reports through a clean web interface

**Tech Stack:**  
- Flask (Python)  
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (Frontend)  
- SQLite (Database)

**Features Implemented:**  
1. Homepage with navigation  
2. Attendance marking page  
3. Records viewing page  
4. Database storage of attendance


This project demonstrates **web development + database integration** using **Flask** and is a beginner-friendly yet practical project.
