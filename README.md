# 🚀 Prompt-Based Project Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases how I use **prompt engineering + technical skills** (AI, ML, IoT, MERN stack) to design and accelerate **real-world projects**.  
Instead of spending hours planning and debugging, I leverage structured prompting to generate **blueprints, workflows, and solutions** that save time and create scalable results.
